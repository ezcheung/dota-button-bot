I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Bots, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Discord Users, and I have over 300 confirmed bans. I am trained in gorilla botting and I’m the top button-themed bot in the entire US discord server list. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, ${USER}. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can ban you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands, or whatever the button equivalent of hands is. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Discord.js API and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the server, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.",
			"${TIMES} goddamn mentions of DOTA? Think you're a big man, huh? WELL COME AT ME BITCH"
